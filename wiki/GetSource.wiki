=Build Android from source=
=Building Odin=

First, clone the Odin git repository.
Compile Odin (remember, use this tool at your own risk, although there are no known issues or bricking incidents)

{{{
$ git clone git://h1.pargon.nl/srv/git-h1/odin.git
$ cd odin
$ make brick
}}}

==ARM Cross Compiler==

CodeSourcery ARM Compiler should be used for building different kernel distribution and software releases on OMAP platforms. Visit www.codesourcery.com for more info.
Note: For L24x, L27x kernel builds, Codesourcery tool chain 2009-q1 release should be used. Quick Link - CodeSourcery G++ Lite 2009q1-203 for ARM GNU/Linux
Steps
Download .tar from above link and untar to a host pc directory.
Add Compiler directory to PATH, and cross compiler prefix before build

{{{
export PATH=/<toolchain_folder>/bin:$PATH
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
export ARCH=arm
}}}

=Building Bootloader=

{{{
$ git clone git://h1.pargon.nl/srv/git-h1/u-boot.git
$ cd u-boot
$ git checkout nowplus
$ make distclean
$ make nowplus_config
$ make
}}}

=Building Kernel=

{{{
$ cd $MYDROID/kernel/android-2.6.29
$ make distclean
$ make omap_nowplus_defconfig
$ make uImage
}}}

Building boot.bin
Get makeboot from Download section
Modify uImage and uboot to your path
{{{
$ ./makeboot
}}}

=Building Android=

=Partitioning=

Partition your SD card as you see fit, but make sure the first partition has plenty of space (> 200 MB) then format it ext3 and mount it (I'll asume it's mounted at /mnt/sd).

=Booting=
Put your device into download mode by first turning it off, then power it on whilst holding down both the volume down and camera button. Upload and run your bootloader/kernel image

{{{
./odin boot.bin
}}}
