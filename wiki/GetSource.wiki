Compiling Odin

First, clone the Odin git repository
git clone git://h1.pargon.nl/srv/git-h1/odin.git
Compile Odin (remember, use this tool at your own risk, although there are no known issues or bricking incidents)
cd odin
make brick
Partitioning

Partition your SD card as you see fit, but make sure the first partition has plenty of space (> 200 MB) then format it ext3 and mount it (I'll asume it's mounted at /mnt/sd).

Bootloader and kernel

Booting MeeGo

Put your device into download mode by first turning it off, then power it on whilst holding down both the volume down and camera button. Upload and run your bootloader/kernel image
./odin boot.bin
